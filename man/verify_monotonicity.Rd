\title{Check if an AVL dataframe satisfies assumptions of monotonicity.}
\usage{
verify_monotonicity(distance_df, check_speed = FALSE, return_full = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{distance_df}{Dataframe of linear AVL distances. Must include: "trip_id_performed", "time", and numeric "distance".}

\item{check_speed}{Optional. Boolean, should the Fritsch-Carlson conditions for slopes be checked? Default is FALSE, where the speed check will return NA.}
}
\value{
A named vector of booleans indicating whether each of the three conditions are satisfied.
}
\description{
This function check whether a provided dataframe of linear distances is non-decreasing.
Three conditions are checked: weak monotonicity (flat or increasing), strict monotonicity (increasing only), and speed (whether slopes satisfy Fritsch-Carlson conditions for slopes).
}
