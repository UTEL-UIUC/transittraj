\title{Get the distances of stops along routes.}
\usage{
get_stop_distances(gtfs, shape_geometry = NULL, project_crs = 4326)
}
\arguments{
\item{gtfs}{A tidygtfs object.}

\item{shape_geometry}{Optional. The SF object to project onto. Must include
the field \code{shape_id}. See \code{get_shape_geometry()}. Default is NULL, where
all shapes in \code{gtfs} will be used.}

\item{project_crs}{Optional. A numeric EPSG identifer indicating the
coordinate system to use for spatial calculations. Consider setting to a
Euclidian projection, such as the appropriate UTM zone. Default is 4326 (WGS
84 ellipsoid).}
}
\value{
A dataframe containing \code{stop_id}, the \code{shape_id} it was projected
onto, and \code{distance}, in units of the spatial projection (e.g., meters if
using UTM).
}
\description{
This function returns the linear distance of each stop along a route shape,
starting from the route's beginning terminal. Unless a \code{shape_geometry} is
provided, stops will be project onto all \code{shape_id}s that serve them. If a
\code{shape_geometry} is provided, the function will look only for stops served
by that shape.
