\title{Removes observations occuring before the trip's minimum distance, or after a trip's maximum distance.}
\usage{
trim_trips(distance_df, trim_type = "both", return_removals = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{distance_df}{Dataframe of linear AVL distances. Must include: "trip_id_performed", POSIXct "event_timestamp", and numeric "distance".}

\item{trim_type}{Optional. A string, indicating whether the beginning of trips, end of trips, or both beginning and end of trips should be trimmed. Must be one of "beginning", "end", or "both". Default is "beginning".}
}
\value{
The input distance_df, with violating observations removed.
}
\description{
Sometimes observations will be recorded under a trip while that vehicle is still traveling in the opposite direction. Conversely, a trip may continue recording as it begins traversing the opposite direction.
This function attempts to remove these observations by identifying each trip's minimum (beginning) and maximum (ending) distance, then filtering to only observations after and before these points.
