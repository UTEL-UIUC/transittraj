\usage{
clean_incomplete_trips(
  distance_df,
  max_trip_distance = Inf,
  min_trip_distance = -Inf,
  max_trip_duration = Inf,
  min_trip_duration = -Inf,

}
\arguments{
\item{distance_df}{Dataframe of linear AVL distances. Must include: "trip_id_performed", POSIXct "event_timestamp", and numeric "distance".}

\item{max_trip_distance}{Optional. The maximum distance traveled over one trip. Default is Inf.}

\item{min_trip_distance}{Optional. The minimum distance traveled over one trip. Default is -Inf.}

\item{max_trip_duration}{Optional. The maximum event_timestamp duration, in seconds, of one trip. Default is Inf.}

\item{min_trip_duration}{Optional. The minimum event_timestamp duration, in seconds, of one trip. Default is -Inf.}

\item{max_distance_gap}{Optional. The maximum change in distance between two observations. Default is Inf.}

\item{max_time_gap}{Optional. The maximum time between two observations, in seconds. Default is Inf.}

\item{return_removals.}{Optional. A boolean, should the function return a dataframe of the trips removed and why? Default is FALSE.}
}
\value{
The input distance_df, with violating trips removed.
}
\description{
This function filters trips to be within the provided range of total duration or distance traveled.
Trips with excessive time or distance gaps can also be removed.
Trips outside the provided ranges are entirely removed from the dataset.
Units of inputs should match those of distance and time columns in the input dataframe.
