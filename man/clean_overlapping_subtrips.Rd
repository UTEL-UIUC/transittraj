\title{Removes trips with multiple overlapping operators or vehicles assigned to the same trip number.}
\usage{
clean_overlapping_subtrips(
  distance_df,
  remove_single_observations = TRUE,
  remove_non_overlapping = FALSE,
  return_removals = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{distance_df}{A dataframe containing "event_timestamp", "trip_id_performed", "operator_id", and "vehicle_id". Either linearized or raw AVL points will work.}

\item{remove_single_observations}{Optional. A boolean, should subtrips with only one observation be removed? Default is TRUE.}

\item{remove_non_overlapping}{Optional. A boolean, should trips with multiple vehicles or operators that do not overlap be removed? Default is FALSE.}

\item{return_removals}{Optional. A boolean, should the function return a dataframe of trips removed and why? Default is FALSE.}
}
\value{
The input distance_df, with violating trips removed. If return_removals = TRUE, a dataframe with trip IDs and the reason why it was identified for removal.
}
\description{
In some AVL vendors, multiple vehicles or operators may be logged to the same trip ID at the same time.
This may be acceptable in some scenarios (e.g., a vehicle/operator tradeoff mid-trip). Other times, it may be an error, with these distinct (trip, vehicle, operator) running simulataneously.
This function identifies both scenarios, and gives the option to remove one or both.
