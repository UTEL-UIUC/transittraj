\title{Removes trips with multiple overlapping operators or vehicles assigned to the
same trip number.}
\usage{
clean_overlapping_subtrips(
  distance_df,
  check_operator = FALSE,
  remove_single_observations = TRUE,
  remove_non_overlapping = FALSE,
  return_removals = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{distance_df}{A dataframe of linearized AVL data. Must include
\code{event_timestamp}, \code{trip_id_performed}, and \code{vehicle_id}. Optionally, may
include \code{operator_id}.}

\item{check_operator}{Optional. A boolean, should overlaps of multiple
\code{operator_id}s be checked for? Default is FALSE.}

\item{remove_single_observations}{Optional. A boolean, should subtrips with
only one observation be removed? Default is TRUE.}

\item{remove_non_overlapping}{Optional. A boolean, should trips with multiple
vehicles or operators that do not overlap be removed? Default is FALSE.}

\item{return_removals}{Optional. A boolean, should the function return a
dataframe of trips removed and why? Default is FALSE.}
}
\value{
The input distance_df, with violating trips removed. If
return_removals = TRUE, a dataframe with trip IDs and the reason why it was
identified for removal.
}
\description{
In some AVL vendors, multiple vehicles or operators may be logged to the same
trip ID at the same time. This may be acceptable in some scenarios (e.g., a
vehicle/operator tradeoff mid-trip). Other times, it may be an error, with
these distinct (trip, vehicle, operator) truples running simulataneously.
This function identifies both scenarios, and gives the option to remove one
or both.
