Description: Today's public transit vehicles produce a large amount of automatic
    vehicle location (AVL) data. This data is very useful for planning and
    performance studies, but can be noisy, error-prone, and sparse. This package
    provides tools for cleaning AVL point data and turning it into continuous,
    differentiable, monotonic, and invertible vehicle trajectory functions.
